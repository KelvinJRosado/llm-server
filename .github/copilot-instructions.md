Dependency packages should use specific pinned versions for reproducibility.

Always follow best practices for typescript development with ESM. Code should always be documented with clear and concise comments.

Code should focus on being maintainable, secure, and efficient. Avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.

When writing tests, ensure they are comprehensive and cover edge cases. Use descriptive names for test cases to clarify their purpose.

When adding new code, only add what was asked. Do not add extra code or features unless explicitly requested.

When writing code, always consider the performance implications. Avoid unnecessary computations and optimize for speed where possible.

This project is an API server that uses TypeScript and Express. It is designed to be modular and scalable, with a focus on clean architecture principles.
Use the latest stable versions of dependencies unless otherwise specified.
When writing code, always use the latest stable version of TypeScript and follow the latest ECMAScript standards.

Ensure that all code is properly formatted and adheres to the project's coding style guidelines. Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to maintain consistency.

When writing documentation, ensure it is clear, concise, and provides enough context for users to understand how to use the code effectively.
When writing code, always consider security implications. Avoid common vulnerabilities and follow best practices for secure coding
practices.
Use TypeScript's type system effectively to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors. Use interfaces and types to define clear contracts for your code.
When writing code, always consider the maintainability of the codebase. Write modular, reusable code
that is easy to test and refactor. Avoid tightly coupled code and strive for separation of concerns.
When writing code, always consider the scalability of the application. Design the code to handle increased load
and ensure it can be easily extended in the future. Use design patterns and best practices to achieve this.
When writing code, always consider the user experience. Ensure that the API is easy to use
and provides clear error messages. Use consistent naming conventions and follow RESTful principles where applicable.
